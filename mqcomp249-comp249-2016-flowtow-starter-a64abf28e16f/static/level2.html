	<h1>Level 2</h1>

        <p>&lt;&lt; <a href="level1.html">Level 1</a> | <a href="level3.html">Level 3</a> &gt;&gt;</p>

    <p>For this level, you will add the database backend to the application and generate pages
    based on the result of queries to the database. You will also implement the action for the
    <em>Like</em> button.</p>

    <p>The functional requirements are encoded in the <code>level2_functional.py</code> unit tests. This
    level also includes unit tests on the procedures you will write, these are encoded in
    <code>level2_unit.py</code>.  Your application should pass both of these tests when you complete
    this level (as well as continuing to pass the tests for Level 1).</p>

	 <h2>Functional requirements</h2>

<p>As for <a href="level1.html">Level 1</a> plus:</p>

	<ul class="list-group">
	    <li class="list-group-item">
            <h4 class="list-group-item-heading">Home Page Images</h4>


            <p>As a visitor to the site, when I load the home page I see three images displayed, each
	    labelled with a date, a user name and the number of 'Likes' for the image. The images are
            displayed in order of their date, the most recent image is at the top of the page.</p>

            <p class='bg-info'>This time, you will use the <code>list_images</code> procedure from
            the <code>interface</code>
            module to get the list of images.  The tests will check that you are using the database
            rather than hard-coding the images (note that we might change the image list when we
            run the tests for marking).</p>

            <p class='bg-info'>Each image will be contained in a &lt;div&gt; with class 'flowtow', that div will
            contain the user nick, date and number of likes each inside an element of class <code>user</code>,
            <code>date</code> and <code>likes</code> respectively.</p>
        </li>

	    <li class="list-group-item">
            <h4 class="list-group-item-heading">Liking an Image</h4>

            <p>As a visitor to the site, when I click on "Like" below an image, the page refreshes and has one
            more like added to the total for that image.</p>

            <p class='bg-info'>The response to the form submission will be a redirect (303 See Other)
                response back to the home page.  When that page is then requested by the browser
                (interpreting the redirect), the new likes total will appear
                along with the appropriate image.</p>
        </li>

	</ul>

	<h2>Unit Tests</h2>

<p>This level adds an SQLite database to the implementation.  All procedures will be implemented in
    the module <code>interface.py</code>, a version has been supplied that contains the procedure
    stubs only.</p>


<ol class="list-group">
	<li class="list-group-item">There is a procedure <code>list_images</code> that takes a
        two arguments, a database connection and
		a number  <code>n</code> and returns a list of
	the most recent <code>n</code> images that have been uploaded along with their details.  The return
	value will be a list of dictionaries with one dictionary per image. Each dictionary will contain four
	keys: <code>filename</code>, <code>timestamp</code>, <code>usernick</code> and <code>likes</code>.
        <code>filename</code> is the path
	to the image relative to
	the default image directory, <code>timestamp</code> is a date string in the format "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS",
	<code>usernick</code> is the nick of the owner
	of the image and <code>likes</code> is the number of likes recorded for this image.
	The images will be returned in reverse order of their timestamp, with the most recent image first.</li>

	<li class="list-group-item">There is a procedure <code>add_image</code> which takes
        three arguments, a database connection and
		the name of an image
	file and the user nick of the owner of the image.  The image name is stored
	in the database along with the user nick and the current date. (Note that this
        prodecure doesn't handle the image file itself, it just stores a record of
        the file in the database).
	</li>

    <li class="list-group-item">There is a procedure <code>add_like</code> which takes three arguments,
        a database connection, the name of an image file and an optional usernick.  A record is
        added to the database recording this like. If no usernick is supplied, the field is set
        to None (NULL).  If the user is not known to the system (not in the users table) then
        no action is taken.  If the named image does not exist in the database, no action is taken.
    </li>

    <li class="list-group-item">There is a procedure <code>count_likes</code> which takes two arguments,
        a database connection and the name of an image file.  The procedure returns the total
        number of likes (from any user or anonymous likes) for this image.  If the image does
        not exist, the procedure returns 0.
    </li>
 </ol>

  <p>The Starter Kit includes a module for creating and interfacing to
		the database. This module is <a href="database.html">described here</a>. </p>

<h2>Your Task</h2>


	<p>To achieve these requirements you will need to extend your application to
	interface to the SQLite database and write code to pass the unit tests for the
	database interface. The techniques to do this are covered here:</p>
